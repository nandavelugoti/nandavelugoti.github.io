# About Me
![Display Picture]({{ site.avatar }})

*Hello there ðŸ‘‹, fellow living being! [Unless...](/images/robots.png)ðŸ˜§*

I am Nanda Velugoti, a 2nd year Computer Science PhD student at [Illinois Tech](cs.iit.edu) and Research Assistant at [HExSA Lab](https://www.halek.co/#people). I am advised by [Dr. Kyle Hale](https://www.halek.co/). I am also a PhD Intern (part-time) at [Pacific Northwest National Laboratory](https://www.pnnl.gov) working as part the HPC Group lead by [Dr. Nathan Tallent](https://hpc.pnnl.gov/people/tallent/).

My research interests are Systems and HPC (High Performance Computing) areas in Computer Science. I like researching on hardware/software components (memory, storage, cpu, os, etc) in computing systems and propose solutions to help improve overall system performance optimized for specific workloads. I am currently working on concurrency aware memory analysis of parallel applications on heterogeneous architectures.

I initially worked as a software development engineer for 3 years at [Temenos](https://www.temenos.com) (formerly [Kony Labs](https://www.temenos.com/news/2020/10/16/kony-is-now-temenos/)) in Hyderabad, India. I moved to US to pursue my research studies at [Illinois Tech](cs.iit.edu). I started out as a Masters student (graduated 2021) and currently continuing as a PhD student since 2021.
